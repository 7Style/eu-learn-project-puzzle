Introduction to the Project
This guide is designed to walk you through the JavaScript coding project, which is a game developed for students learning programming. The game is structured into different levels, each introducing new concepts and challenges. You'll learn how to set up the project, understand the code structure, and modify or extend the game.

Project Structure
The project consists of several files that work together to create the game:

app.html: The main HTML file that structures the game's layout.
styles.css: The CSS file for styling the game's appearance.
JavaScript files:
app.js: The main JavaScript file that initializes the game.
config.js: Contains configuration settings for the game.
commands.js, game.js, konfetti.js: Handle game logic, commands, and effects.
level2.js, level3.js, level4.js: Define the logic for different levels of the game.
store.js: Manages data storage for the game.
Setting Up the Game
HTML Setup (app.html):

The HTML file contains the basic structure of the game, including the game board and control buttons.
Examine the HTML to understand how the game's visual elements are structured.
Styling (styles.css):

The CSS file defines the appearance of the game.
Review the CSS to learn how the game elements are styled.
JavaScript Integration:

app.js initializes the game by creating instances of the game classes.
Each level file (level2.js, level3.js, level4.js) contains specific logic for that level.
Understanding Game Mechanics
Game Initialization (app.js):

The game is initialized and the appropriate level is loaded based on the stored level or default settings.
Game Logic:

game.js: Contains the core logic of the game, such as character movement and game state management.
commands.js: Handles the commands that control the character's movements.
konfetti.js: Adds visual effects like confetti for celebrations.
Level Design:

Each level file extends the game with new rules and challenges.
level2.js, level3.js, and level4.js each add unique features to the game.
Modifying the Game
Adjusting Game Settings (config.js):

Change settings like default paths, level settings, and more.
Experiment with different configurations to see how they affect the game.
Enhancing Levels:

Modify the level files to change the game's challenges.
Add new obstacles, change the layout, or create new rules.
Customizing Appearance:

Edit styles.css to change the game's visual design.
Try altering colors, sizes, or adding new styles.
Extending the Game
Add New Levels:

Create new JavaScript files for additional levels.
Use the existing level files as templates to build upon.
Integrate New Features:

Add features like score tracking, time limits, or new game mechanics.
Conclusion
This guide provides a basic overview of the game's structure and functionality. As you explore the files and experiment with the code, you'll gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript and game development. Remember, the best way to learn programming is by doing, so don't hesitate to modify the code and try new ideas.
